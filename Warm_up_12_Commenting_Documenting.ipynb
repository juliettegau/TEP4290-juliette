    "These can be up to taste:\n",
    "\n",
    "From the Real Python tutorial:\n",
    "- Keep comments as close as possible to the code that they describe.\n",
    "- Don't use complex formatting such as tables or ASCII figures.\n",
    "- Don't include redundant information.\n",
    "- Design your code to comment itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/12/23/best-practices-for-writing-code-comments/:\n",
    "- Rule 1: Comments should not duplicate the code.\n",
    "- Rule 2: Good comments do not excuse unclear code.\n",
    "- Rule 3: If you can’t write a clear comment, there may be a problem with the code.\n",
    "- Rule 4: Comments should dispel confusion, not cause it.\n",
    "- Rule 5: Explain unidiomatic code in comments.\n",
    "- Rule 6: Provide links to the original source of copied code.\n",
    "- Rule 7: Include links to external references where they will be most helpful.\n",
    "- Rule 8: Add comments when fixing bugs. \n",
    "- Rule 9: Use comments to mark incomplete implementations.\n",

      "    -----\n",
      "    In Python, objects can declare their textual representation using the\n",
      "    `__repr__` method. IPython expands on this idea and allows objects to declare\n",
      "    other, rich representations including:\n",
      "\n",
      "      - HTML\n",
      "      - JSON\n",
      "      - PNG\n",
      "      - JPEG\n",
      "      - SVG\n",
      "      - LaTeX\n",
      "\n",
      "    A single object can declare some or all of these representations; all are\n",
      "    handled by IPython's display system.\n",
      "\n",
      "    The main idea of the first approach is that you have to implement special\n",
      "    display methods when you define your class, one for each representation you\n",
      "    want to use. Here is a list of the names of the special methods and the\n",
      "    values they must return:\n",
      "\n",
      "      - `_repr_html_`: return raw HTML as a string, or a tuple (see below).\n",
      "      - `_repr_json_`: return a JSONable dict, or a tuple (see below).\n",
      "      - `_repr_jpeg_`: return raw JPEG data, or a tuple (see below).\n",
      "      - `_repr_png_`: return raw PNG data, or a tuple (see below).\n",
      "      - `_repr_svg_`: return raw SVG data as a string, or a tuple (see below).\n",
      "      - `_repr_latex_`: return LaTeX commands in a string surrounded by \"$\",\n",
      "                        or a tuple (see below).\n",
      "      - `_repr_mimebundle_`: return a full mimebundle containing the mapping\n",
      "                             from all mimetypes to data.\n",
      "                             Use this for any mime-type not listed above.\n",
      "\n",
      "    The above functions may also return the object's metadata alonside the\n",
      "    data.  If the metadata is available, the functions will return a tuple\n",
      "    containing the data and metadata, in that order.  If there is no metadata\n",
      "    available, then the functions will return the data only.\n",
      "\n",
      "    When you are directly writing your own classes, you can adapt them for\n",
      "    display in IPython by following the above approach. But in practice, you\n",
      "    often need to work with existing classes that you can't easily modify.\n",
      "\n",
      "    You can refer to the documentation on integrating with the display system in\n",
      "    order to register custom formatters for already existing types\n",
